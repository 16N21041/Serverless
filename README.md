# Serverless
Server less e-learning Platform  

In this I have build a simple e-learning platform using AWS Lambda for serverless architecture, AWS Cognito for user authentication, AWS DynamoDB that stores all the user data after the user has signed up using Lambda triggers that has been generated by Cognito. AWS IAM has been used to create AWSDynamoDBFullAccess role that is attatched with Lambda to access DynamoDB.
Using Lambda made this application serverless and highly cost efficient. Each time a user signs up, the lambda function is triggered and the entries are made in DynamoDB using putItem operation.

That's it for now :)
