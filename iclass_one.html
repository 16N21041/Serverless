		<h3>AWS Introduction</h3>
		<i>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 165 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers —including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—trust AWS to power their infrastructure, become more agile, and lower costs.</i>
		<p><strong>What is AWS?</strong> – Amazon Web Services(AWS) is a cloud service from Amazon, which provides services in the form of building blocks, these building blocks can be used to create and deploy any type of application in the cloud.<br>These services or building blocks are designed to work with each other, and result in applications which are sophisticated and highly scalable.</p>
		<p><strong>Most Functionality:</strong><br>AWS provides services for broad range of applications including compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), security, and application development, deployment, and management.
		<br>
		In addition to having the greatest breadth of services, AWS also has the deepest functionality within those services. For example, Amazon EC2 offers more types and sizes of compute instances than any other provider, including the most powerful GPU instances for machine learning workloads. AWS also has more than double the number of database services than anyone else, with eleven relational and non-relational database offerings. And, AWS has the most ways to run containers, with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS), and AWS Fargate.
		<br>
		This broad selection of services and deep functionality make it easier, faster, and more cost-effective to migrate your existing apps to the cloud and build nearly anything you could imagine.</p>
		<p><strong>Most Secure:</strong>
			AWS has been architected to be the most flexible and secure cloud computing environment available today. Our core infrastructure is built to satisfy the security requirements for military, global banks, and other high-sensitivity organizations.
			<br>
			AWS uses the same secure hardware and software to build and operate each of our regions, so all of our customers benefit from the only commercial cloud that has had its service offerings and associated supply chain vetted and accepted as secure enough for top secret workloads. This is backed by a deep set of cloud security tools, with 203 security, compliance, and governance services and key features.
			<br>
			Moreover, AWS supports 85 security standards and compliance certifications, and all 116 AWS services that store customer data offer the ability to encrypt that data.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Fastest pace of innovation:</strong>
			AWS released 1,957 new services and features in 2018, innovating at an unmatched pace, especially in new areas such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, and Serverless Computing. With AWS, you can take advantage of the latest technologies to innovate, differentiate, and deliver solutions fast.
			<br>
			For example, in 2014, AWS pioneered the event-driven serverless computing space with the launch of AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda lets developers run their code without provisioning or managing servers, and you don’t have to worry about provisioning, scaling, patching, or managing any of the underlying servers.
			<br>
			In 2018, AWS became the first cloud provider to offer 100 Gbps of network bandwidth with our C5n EC2 instance types. This higher network performance can speed up results for a wide range of analytics, machine learning, big data, and data lake applications.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Largest community of customers and partners:</strong>
			AWS has the largest and most dynamic ecosystem, with millions of active customers and tens of thousands of partners globally. Customers across virtually every industry and of every size, including start-ups, enterprises, and public sector organizations, are running every imaginable use case on AWS.
			<br>
			The AWS partner network includes thousands of systems integrators who specialize in AWS services and tens of thousands of independent software vendors (ISVs) who adapt their technology to work on AWS.
			<br>
			The AWS Marketplace, a digital catalog of software from ISVs that runs on AWS, offers 35 categories and more than 4,500 software listings from more than 1,400 ISVs, nearly two times more software listings than you can find anywhere else.</p>
		<p><strong>Most proven operational expertise:</strong>
			AWS has unmatched experience, maturity, reliability, security, and performance. AWS has been delivering cloud services for over 12 years to millions of customers around the world running a wide variety of use cases, and has the most operational experience, at greater scale, than any cloud provider.
			<br>
			Years of operating with many times the usage of any other cloud provider, combined with listening and learning from our customers and our commitment to constant iteration help us deliver superior operational performance that you can depend on for your most important workloads.</p>
